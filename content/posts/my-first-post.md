## Introduction

This is my first post using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as platform. The idea its to post here my discoveries about home-smart and also from my programing life.

So as start im going to post about Hugo. This is a tool to create static content, that means no javascript o compilation when any one do a request to the server.

So all you need its a little of time, learn MD and use github pages. Hugo have a great documentation, so i leave the link to that [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

Also im adding here some usefull notes in case i need this on the future:

``` 
# Generate new content entry:
hugo new content content/posts/my-first-post.md

# hugo server --buildDrafts

```
